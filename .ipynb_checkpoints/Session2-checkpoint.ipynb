    "Complex sampling designs for surveys are commonly applied by employing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- stratification (divide the population in homogenous groups and sample from each group a specific number);\n",
    "- clustering (divide the population in groups, e.g. regions, and sample from a random subset of this groups);\n",
    "- unequal sampling (oversampling of subgroups of interest).\n",

    "Considering these samples as random samples will result in biased standard errors. \n",

    "A commmon approach to account for the bias is providing design weights. Most surveys using complex sampling strategies are providing weights to adjust for the deviation from the random sampling.\n"
